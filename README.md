# Movie-ETL

## Objective
The overall goal of the project is to utilize Python to extract our movie data from Wikipedia and Kaggle, prepare the dataframe through series of steps, and eventually load the merged dataframe to our SQL server. In this project, we have the opportunity to practice defining various functions, utilizing regular expression to extract value from text, and more.
